# new-portfolio
Personal portfolio for Daniel Destefanis, built with <a href="https://github.com/callmecavs/outset">outset</a> boilerplate.

Please feel free to use this code as a jumping off point for your own portfolio, project, or learning tool :)

This is my previous portfolio so it's no longer hosted. View the link below for the example!

## How to

In order to use the environment, navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run the `gulp` command.

Give the script a moment to build (you may have to refresh your browser) and then you should be able to work without needing to refresh again.

Work within the `src` folder.

For hosting your own portfolio, use the contents of the `dist` folder which is compiled. *Note this folder is overwritten everytime a change is made in `src` so do not edit content within it*.
